# Factory Method
**Factory Method** is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.

The Factory Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of using a direct constructor call (new operator). Subclasses can override this method to change the class of objects that will be created.
