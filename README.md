# DesignPatterns
This is a study purpose branch to save design pattern c# examples. Inside the main folder you will see the following tree. 

- **Creational**
  - Abstract Factory
    - _Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes._
  - Builder
    - _Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code._
  - Factory Method
    - _Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created._
  - Prototype
    - _Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes._
- **Structural**
  - Adapter
    - _Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate._
