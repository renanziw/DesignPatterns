# DesignPatterns
This is a study purpose branch to save design pattern c# examples. Inside the main folder you will see the following tree. 

- Creational
  - Abstract Factory
    - Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
  - Builder
    - Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
  - Factory Method
    - Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
  - Prototype
    - Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
